# What is ResMark? 

ResMark is system designed to streamline attendance and quiz monitoring in educational institutions by integrating geolocation technology with the robust security of blockchain. Built on ResilientDB and ResVault, this system offers a secure and tamper-proof solution to ensure fairness and accuracy in tracking students' attendance and quiz submissions. Using HTML5 Geolocation and JavaScript, ResMark determines the coordinates of the classroom location and verifies whether a studentâ€™s request originates within a 50-meter proximity of the class. If the student is physically present within this geofenced area, they are granted access to mark their attendance and proceed to take the quiz. By combining geofencing and blockchain, ResMark eliminates fraudulent attempts at remote check-ins or quiz submissions, ensuring that attendance and quiz participation are strictly tied to physical presence.

Install GraphQL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResilientDB-GraphQL
```

Setup SDK:
```bash
bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/client.config service/http_server/server_config.config
```

### ResVault

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb-resvault
```

Steps -
1. Generate the build file
2. Enable developr mode and unpack the build file in chrome extensions.
3. Register on ResVault

## Running the ResMark Application

Clone the repo and open it in a new folder.
